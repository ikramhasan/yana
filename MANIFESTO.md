# The `yana` manifesto

There are thousands of note taking apps out there. Why yana?

<br />

Yana (yet another note app) came into existence due to a personal struggle of finding a simple, opensource, markdown based note taking app for my daily note taking needs. While there are a lot of note taking apps out there, nothing fit my unique requirements. Read the manifesto to understand yana’s reason for existence.

## Markdown as the source of truth

Yana supports standard markdown syntax. That’s it. No diagrams, no frontmatter, nothing else. I didn’t want my notes to only be viewable in one application. If in future you want to retire yana, you can. You can still read your notes in VSCode, GitHub, or the multitude of note taking apps out there that support markdown. Obsidian was a ray of hope for me on this regard for a long time (see more in comparion.md). But it wasn’t open source, kept introducing blocks outside of standard markdown, and there community plugins only made things worse. Yana is boring by design on this regard.

## No plugin support by design

I think I spent more of my time browsing plugins on the obsidian plugin marketplace than actually writing stuff. If a plugin provides enough value for you to install it through the marketplace, it should not be hidden in a store, it should be a default feature of the note taking app, accessible for everyone. The open source requirement came from this philosophy.

## Fast, small, and simple

I take a lot of notes everyday. I open my note taking app dozens of times. It is non-negotiable for my note app to be really fast, with a really small foorprint - both in terms of resource usage and size. Yana is 12 megabytes in size, and you need to scroll to the bottom of your activity monitor to find it. I don’t have to be afraid of opening my note app anymore while working on a large project, as it should be. Yana stays out of your way. Hide the sidebar, and the only thing visible in your screen is your content.

## Open source

Yana is open source, with MIT license. You can clone it, contribute to it, file issues, sell it, create your own personal version of it - as you wish. Yana is open source, and always will be. If in future I introduce a sync server, it is my promise that will be open source as well.
